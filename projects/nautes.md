## LLC
This will be a whole thing.
### Registration Fee
#### Cost before registering your Florida LLC
Unlike most states, Florida doesn't offer name reservation before LLC registration. Instead, you can register what's known as a "fictitious" name for your LLC.

If you don't necessarily want to start your LLC under your legal name, you can do business under a different name, also known as a "doing business as" (DBA ) name. You must register and file your DBA name with the [Florida Division of Corporations.](http://form.sunbiz.org/pdf/CR4E001.pdf) There is a $50 filing fee, and the name is valid for five years.
#### Costs of registering Your Florida LLC
In order to form an LLC, most states require you to draft and file articles of organization. The [articles of organization](https://www.legalzoom.com/articles/llc-articles-of-organization) is a document that officially establishes your LLC by laying out basic information about your business. You can file your articles of organization with the [Florida Division of Corporations](https://efile.sunbiz.org/llc_file.html) for $100.All LLCs are required to appoint a registered agent. A [registered agent](https://www.legalzoom.com/articles/what-is-a-registered-agent) is a person or entity authorized to receive service of process and other official legal documents and notices on behalf of your LLC. You may have the owner or an employee serve as your registered agent, but keep in mind this individual has to be available at all times to receive documents. Many LLCs opt to hire a third-party registered agent service. The cost can range anywhere between $50 to $500 annually.

Florida has a mandatory registration fee of $25 regardless of whether you use an in-house or outside service for an agent.

Articles of organization in Florida must be filed with the Florida Division of Corporations. There is a $125 processing fee, which includes the designation of the registered agent. The processing time in Florida is usually between 2 to 14 business days.
