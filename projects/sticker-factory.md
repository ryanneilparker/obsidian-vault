## Research
Pick one or more of the ideas below and do the following:

1. Market Size and Competitors Analysis: Research the market to understand how many people or businesses might be interested in your product or service. Look into existing competitors in that market space. Check what they offer, their strengths, weaknesses, and how they attract customers. Tools like Google Trends, industry reports, or market research firms can help gauge the demand and competition.

2. Target Demographics and Marketing Avenues: Define who your potential customers are based on factors like age, gender, location, income level, interests, and behaviors. This helps in creating a focused marketing strategy. Find out where your target audience spends time online or offline (social media, forums, events) to tailor your marketing efforts effectively.

3. Revenue Model and Business Plan: Outline how your business intends to make money. Consider various revenue models like selling products, offering subscriptions, providing services, etc. Develop a clear and concise business plan that includes your value proposition, target market, marketing strategy, operational plan, and financial projections. This plan acts as a roadmap for your business, guiding decisions and actions.

Present your finding at the next meeting where we will make the final decision on which project to go forward with.
