In [[sporos]], Energy is harvested from the sun wherever possible, like the [[desalination-plant]]. The most modular and distributed model is solar cells. To store the energy, again a passive solution is preferred in the form of gravity batteries. Each [[hexagon]] has it's own [[gravity-battery]] and [[solar-farm]]

## gravity battery calculation

$$energy = m\times g\times h$$
With a weight of water of $10000kg$ of water (~$10m^3$) suspended in a shaft of depth $10m$ provides an energy potential of $10000\times 9.81\times 10 = 9810000 J$. During freefall the maximum output of the battery is $1,373,400W$.

Below is a depiction of the rate of descent required to sustain a $1kW$ power supply for a range of weight masses:
