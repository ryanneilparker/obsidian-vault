sporos is a decentralized totally distributed, autonomously organized, collectivist socio-economic structure for a society that wants to rid itself of the disease of property but retain the benefits of the free market.

each [[citizen]] of sporos is allocated a [[hexagon]] and allowed to participate in the [[free-market]].
each [[citizen]] of sporos can also participate in [[distributed-decision-making]] using the [[distributed-network]].
sporos has no government rather a pure form of [[distributed-direct-democracy]] is used to create [[contracts]] that govern the nature of the [[collective-system]].

each [[hexagon]] in sporos has a [[solar-farm]] the generates [[energy]] that is stored in a [[gravity-battery]].
each [[hexagon]] is also capable of using a [[desalination-plant]] to generate [[water]].
each [[hexagon]] is also capable of using a [[hydroponic-garden]] to produce [[food]].

[[transportation]] in sporos is achieved using [[autonomous-vehicle]]s that move at a fixed speed and are group-aware.

the [[collective-system]] is a set of algorithms that define how interactions between citizens and the free market occur. Citizens are otherwise free of any restrictions, however other citizens may vote on [[contracts]] that augment the nature of the system.
